              <div class="panel-content">A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building something cool. Students are encouraged to come up with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea (typically through programming!) into a product in 48 hours. We want you to take something you love (sports, art, camping, anything!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.</div>
